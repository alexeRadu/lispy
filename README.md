# A simple Lisp interpreter written in python

This is based on the tutorial found [here](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).

The purpose for making this tutorial was two fold:
 * an introduction into lisp
 * an introduction into compilers/interpreters

The second point is of moderate importance to me. I whish to better
understand compilers so that I may be a better programmer but ,for now
at least, I don't plan on doing any other project which involves creating
a fully-fledged language/compiler.

The first point is what motivated this tutorial. I've started learning
elisp (emacs's version of lisp) but some notions elude me. I get them but
I don't seem to fully understand them; so I thought that the best way to
fully understand the concepts is to create a lisp interpreter.
The tutorial in the link seems to make it simple enough.
